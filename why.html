    <small>Why are we making games? What brought us to put our effort into this project instead of just going to 
    a normal job, get our money and live happily ever after? 
    You can read about our motivation here, either the full explanation, or if you really cannot read more than 140 characters :( , the compact form on the right. </small>

      <p> We are unhappy with how stuff are done in our society, this is clear. But exactly why and how? 
        These are questions that we are trying to address every day, if not more often.
        Even though we do not have a clear answer, we are starting to get to see some patterns.
        Most of the things that we do, we do it that way, because it is <strong>easier</strong> and 
        because <strong>we are used to do it that way </strong>. 
        So, if (very optimistic if) we can try to do something, is to change the way people see the everyday task
        and how they plan their projects. </p>

      <p class="w3-tag w3-round w3-blue" style="text-align:left"><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong><br>
        We are aware that games are just a small part of our education, and there would be many other things 
        that we could spend our time on, instead. But everybody has their own passion, and we try to combine
        what we like with what we should do, so we opted for this project this time. 
        Plus gamification has shown to be an unexpectedly extremely powerful resource!
        Add source and images!</p>
      <br>
      <p> So, we took a look at the top board games that are at the moment out there. What did we find? </p>

      <p> We want to promote critical thinking and new ideas of implicit collaboration even when we are compiting.
        We want people to play, enjoy, have fun and at the same time incorporate some of the concepts that could 
        help us develop a more fair and sustainable world! *</p>
